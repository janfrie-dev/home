abstract: A consensus-based optimization (CBO) algorithm, which enables derivative
  and mesh-free global optimization, is presented to localize a bioluminescent source.
  The light propagation is modeled by the radiative transfer equation. Since CBO can
  be easily combined with different forward models, it is investigated for a hierarchy
  of simplified diffusion models; the state-of-the-art diffusive approximation, SP3,
  and an adaptive approach combining the model hierarchy with the CBO dynamics. The
  latter approach allows rendering higher-order models at lower computational cost
  than with a fixed model. All models ensure an accurate localization of the bioluminescent
  sources in simulated environments and tissue-mimicking phantoms. While the diffusive
  approximation gives reliable results for heavily scattering media, higher-order
  models achieve slightly better localizations in strongly absorbing, but only moderately
  scattering media.
