abstract: In this work we present a nonlocal conservation law with a velocity depending
  on an integral term over a part of the space. The model class covers already existing
  models in literature, but it is also able to describe new dynamics mainly arising
  in the context of traffic flow modelling. We prove the existence and uniqueness
  of weak solutions of the nonlocal conservation law. Further, we provide a suitable
  numerical discretization and present numerical examples.
