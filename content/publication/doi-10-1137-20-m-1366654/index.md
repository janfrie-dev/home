abstract: " We consider a system of nonlocal balance laws where each balance law is
  coupled with the remaining balance laws both by a nonlocal velocity function that
  takes into account the averaged density of all other equations and by a right-hand
  “semilinear” term. We demonstrate existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for
  a small time horizon and a maximum principle for additional assumptions on the input
  data. This maximum principle ensures the applicability of the considered system
  of nonlocal balance laws to real-world problems. In the case of traffic flow, we
  show how the nonlocal impact and the coupling via the “semilinear” term can model
  multilane traffic flow with lane changing. We also demonstrate the applicability
  of the model to an on-ramp scenario in which the cars have to move from the on-ramp
  to the adjacent lane within a finite spatial domain. Moreover, we demonstrate how
  the problem of having obstacles can be modeled with these equations, introducing
  an additional ODE for the obstacle's dynamic. Several numerical results are presented
  and their reasonability is discussed. "
