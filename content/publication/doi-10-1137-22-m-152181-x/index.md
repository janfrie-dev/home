abstract: ' Abstract. Using a nonlocal second-order traffic flow model we present
  an approach to control the dynamics toward a steady state. The system is controlled
  by the leading vehicle driving at a prescribed velocity and also determines the
  steady state. Thereby, we consider both the microscopic (trajectory based) and macroscopic
  (density based) scales. We show that the fixed point of the microscopic traffic
  flow model is (locally) asymptotically stable for any kernel function. To obtain
  global stabilization, we present Lyapunov functions for both the microscopic and
  the macroscopic scale and compute the explicit rates at which the vehicles influenced
  by the nonlocality tend toward the stationary solution. We obtain stabilization
  results for a constant kernel function and arbitrary initial data or concave kernels
  and monotone initial data. In particular, the stabilization is exponential in time.
  Numerical examples demonstrate the theoretical results. '
