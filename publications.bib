abstract = { We consider a system of nonlocal balance laws where each balance law is coupled with the remaining balance laws both by a nonlocal velocity function that takes into account the averaged density of all other equations and by a right-hand “semilinear” term. We demonstrate existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for a small time horizon and a maximum principle for additional assumptions on the input data. This maximum principle ensures the applicability of the considered system of nonlocal balance laws to real-world problems. In the case of traffic flow, we show how the nonlocal impact and the coupling via the “semilinear” term can model multilane traffic flow with lane changing. We also demonstrate the applicability of the model to an on-ramp scenario in which the cars have to move from the on-ramp to the adjacent lane within a finite spatial domain. Moreover, we demonstrate how the problem of having obstacles can be modeled with these equations, introducing an additional ODE for the obstacle's dynamic. Several numerical results are presented and their reasonability is discussed. }

abstract = { Abstract. Using a nonlocal second-order traffic flow model we present an approach to control the dynamics toward a steady state. The system is controlled by the leading vehicle driving at a prescribed velocity and also determines the steady state. Thereby, we consider both the microscopic (trajectory based) and macroscopic (density based) scales. We show that the fixed point of the microscopic traffic flow model is (locally) asymptotically stable for any kernel function. To obtain global stabilization, we present Lyapunov functions for both the microscopic and the macroscopic scale and compute the explicit rates at which the vehicles influenced by the nonlocality tend toward the stationary solution. We obtain stabilization results for a constant kernel function and arbitrary initial data or concave kernels and monotone initial data. In particular, the stabilization is exponential in time. Numerical examples demonstrate the theoretical results. }

abstract = {A consensus-based optimization (CBO) algorithm, which enables derivative and mesh-free global optimization, is presented to localize a bioluminescent source. The light propagation is modeled by the radiative transfer equation. Since CBO can be easily combined with different forward models, it is investigated for a hierarchy of simplified diffusion models; the state-of-the-art diffusive approximation, SP3, and an adaptive approach combining the model hierarchy with the CBO dynamics. The latter approach allows rendering higher-order models at lower computational cost than with a fixed model. All models ensure an accurate localization of the bioluminescent sources in simulated environments and tissue-mimicking phantoms. While the diffusive approximation gives reliable results for heavily scattering media, higher-order models achieve slightly better localizations in strongly absorbing, but only moderately scattering media.},
